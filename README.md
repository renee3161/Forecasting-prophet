# Forecasting-prophet
This project performs sales forecasting for different products using the Prophet library. The sales data is provided in an Excel file (product_sold_quantities.xlsx), and the forecasted results are saved in a new Excel file (Sales_Forecast_Results_transformed.xlsx) that includes both forecast values and visualizations of the sales predictions
